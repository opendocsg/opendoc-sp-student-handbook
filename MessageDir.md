# MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR

Dear Students,

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Singapore Polytechnic (SP). I hope you are looking 
forward to the start of the course with the Professional and Adult Continuing Education (PACE) 
Academy at SP. Whether you are a new or returning student, it is my pleasure to welcome you to SP, 
and thank you for choosing SP. 

You have joined the first and foremost Polytechnic in Singapore. Since 1954, SP has educated and 
trained over 160,000 graduates, who form the core of the Singapore workforce. 

You have enrolled into a programme, which has been specially designed for adult learners like yourself. 
On successful completion of every semester, you will be awarded a certificate in recognition of your 
accomplishment. When you have completed all the required certificates, you will be eligible for the 
prestigious award of an SP Post-Diploma/Part-time Diploma. 

I am confident you will find your studies with us rigorous but engaging. Our well-qualified and 
experienced lecturers will work with you to make your learning journey fulfilling and successful. Besides 
hard work, a key to your successful completion will be managing your time between your work, studies 
and family. 

Once again, on behalf of our faculty and staff, we hope that your experience in SP will be a fruitful one. 
I wish you every success in your course, and beyond.
