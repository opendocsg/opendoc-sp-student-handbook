# ABOUT PACE #

Singapore Polytechnic (SP) was the first polytechnic established in 1954. In 1979, it started to offer 
Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses to meet the upgrading needs of its growing number 
of graduates. This expanded later to include CET for all professionals, managers and executives or 
PMEs. In 2008, the Professional & Adult Continuing Education (PACE) Academy was established to 
enable SP to support the efforts of the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC) 
which was mandated to prioritise and champion national productivity initiatives at the sectorial and 
enterprise levels, develop a comprehensive, first-class national CET system and foster a culture of 
productivity and continuous learning and upgrading in Singapore.

PACE Academy continues to offer quality multi-disciplinary CET programmes to about 30,000 PMEs 
over 1,000 courses runs per year. These programmes cater to adult and PMEs who not only may have 
relevant experience but also varied training needs.
